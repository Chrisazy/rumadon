This is a project from 2009-2010, more recently uplaoded to GitHub for preservation. It was one of my first large javascript projects and was actually pretty novel at the time, allowing for an interactive MUD to create and display maps to the user in an isometric fashion. I hope to one day come back and clean this up, while still being constrained to the technologies around in 2010. Then I'll make one using modern frameworks to show how powerful they are.
